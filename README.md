# googlesignin

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

In this project, you will learn to allow google signin in your flutter apps.

Key remarks:
1. Make sure you add your own firebase configurations or you will be using my firebase
2. Make sure to go to the google cloud platform amd copy your application ID under Oauth client (for web) and paste it into your index.html file
3. Last but not least, make sure you run this code on port 5000 (flutter run -d chrome  --web-port 5000)
